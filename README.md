# Background

Achieving seed health is a challenge for many seed systems, especially where quality-declared seed is too expensive or unavailable.

The seedHealth R package is designed to inform common management decisions.

Infection is estimated as a function of environmental conditions and management decisions.

The seedHealth package is designed for use by scientists, extension agents, and policy makers evaluating intervention options and potential recommendations.

It can also be used in multi-stakeholder participatory evaluations of strategies, and as a tool for education and outreach.

The open platform used for development of seedHealth will make it flexible for changes by the seed health community of practice.
